##Time-based jet vertex reconstruction in the CMS

###Background

The recent upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have doubled the collision energy (increasing the collision energy from 8TeV to 13TeV), while proposed Phase-II upgrades following the next shutdown will increase the luminosity (collisions per area per second) by an order of magnitude. [1] A side effect of both of these changes is increasing pileup - when multiple collisions happen sufficiently close enough in time such that it is difficult to associate the final particle states with the vertex from which they eminate. This high pileup environment poses challenges to distinguishing the two major production mechanisms for the Higgs boson - gluon fusion and vector boson fusion (VBF). Separating the two production mechanisms is of crucial importance for precisely understanding electro-weak symmetry breaking.

A novel approach, the development of which is the emphasis of this project, uses the time of arrival of the energy of the particles in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). With a timing measurement precision of approximately 100ps or better, as attained for the first time by the Caltech CMS group [2], one can exploit the time of flight information to reconstruct the origin (interaction vertex) of the particles and test the consistency of the arrival time in the ECAL.

Initial studies using this proposed technique have been carried out with CMS data in 2012 [3,4], with varying success. We continue these proof-of-concept studies, aiming to extend it to a larger and more realistic data set, such as the forward eta and lower pT regime relevant to VBF, with the aim of eventually being able to apply this method to actual CMS data to identify VBF events and remove pileup.
